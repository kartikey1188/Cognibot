I quoted the example of driving a car the last 
week and this week I will continue quoting the   same example. Now, because I did not find, I do 
not think there is a better example to explain how   important it is for us to start learning, I mean 
start driving the car, start writing the program   than simply keep looking at theory and syntax 
and then, lecture videos are very important. But   once you understand what is what, you probably 
should move ahead, and then start coding. 
  That is the first point I would like to tell 
you for the beginning of the second week and   as you know, we tried (giving) making you warm 
up for programming and please note the things   are not as simple as it appeared in week 1, 
things are going to get more complex and that   is the very reason why we use the computer. 
Programming is all about doing complex things   quickly and easily as I keep saying. So this 
week, we are going to see a few more top ups to   programming skill set, which will be; firstly, 
we will tell you what one means by a variable.   It may sound like Greek for you, if you 
are listening it for the first time,   but you will get used to it. 
We keep buckets in our houses to store   entities and we have different kinds 
of buckets, different kinds of jars.   The vessel you use to store milk 
is not used to store let us say,   plain rice. The glass you used to drink water 
is a different glass as compared to what you use   glass to drink coffee or tea. 
We have our own maybe fancy variants   there. But actually, strictly speaking, certain 
things can be put in certain objects only. So   very similarly when a computer has different kinds 
of baskets for different types of entities. If you   want to store an integer, computer stores it 
in a different way; if it is a floating point   number or let us say a real number, it stores 
it in a different way. If it is a string, the   computer stores it in a very different way. 
So we are going to discuss that to begin with,   we are going to introduce you all to what is 
called variables. Variables, in other words,   in a layman's language is a basket as in real 
life and we need to spend some time there,   thanks to Python, things are very, very simple 
as compared to, let us say, the programming   language that that were there in the 90s, as 
I keep saying, things were very hard there.
  Here, Python gives you the flexibility 
to declare these baskets very easily.   We will be starting with variables and we will 
go ahead with some print statement, some advanced   ideas, which I think is important for you all to 
learn and after that, we will be moving ahead to   the if loop conditional statement, 
which is; it sounds very complicated,   it does not even sound like English, 
if I say if loop, but then with time,   you will realize that it is a very, very powerful 
entity in programming and if you understand it,   you understand programming completely. 
So basically, there is this triangle which   I want you all to remember. The triangle 
with one point being if, the other being   for and other being while. These three are three 
simple words in English, but in programming,   they mean something else and you really need to 
know where to use if and how would you use for,   how do you use while. Maybe confusing at this 
moment, but then please bear with me with time,   you will realize what is what. 
We will be discussing the if loop,   writing a couple of code in this direction and 
I will be teaching you the science of secrecy   in its simplest form. How would you encode 
text and send it so that nobody understands it   in its very, very naivest form? In fact, do not 
take whatever we teach seriously because it is a   very toy example. In fact, very advanced ideas 
will come later on in the course. But as of now,   we are going to toy around with some very 
basic examples. That is with the first week.
