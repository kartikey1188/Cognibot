[Music] I hope lock ilog selection is clear uh now we'll try to see how to uh do the editing or how do you add one more column in data frame or how do you modify the the existing values right we can try to focus on that now okay so the first one is adding a column so you can simply say DF it's column e which is equal to whatever is there in column A into 100 for example and let's print TF yeah now you can see that there is fifth column added and here there were only four columns so we added a fifth column just like this this will be very useful for you for creating something like polinomial features in the data frame clear and you can see that this column me the information over here is uh 10 100 times what is there in the frame a in the same way you can create let's say another frame another column column f is equal to TF of a we use information in let's say column A into plus let's say information in column C and again you can print DF I don't know why it is taking so long yeah now there is sixth column that is added getting it h very very simple stuff in the same manner you can modify the existing column so you can say that let's sa if so let's say we want to find out let's put a condition so condition is or criteria right criteria let's say criteria is where DF is where the value in column A is less than let's say5 or less than point two for example right and what we'll do is these value will set it to zero so now what I do is DF of the criteria but in column a i to zero is failed and hashable series Let's see we did now we say criteria okay this is fine there is only one value over here what we can do is DF dolog yeah so what I did is uh we found out the location where this criteria is true and on that location for the First Column we set value to zero you can see this yeah so it was true for the second row so the value in the second R is replaced by zero originally that value was 144 652 is it clear yeah one by one yes who wants to go first the last so 130th the last second last H DF log criteria comma a a what is happening yeah yeah so when you are equating to zero then how it is changing that only true value so basically uh see what is happening here uh so this is uh this is the Boolean series that I have right so for this Boolean series uh that is true only for the for the second row or the row index with B correct so for that Row in the column A I want to change that value to zero where you have mentioned for that row only through through through crer through criteria and this criteria has this series right you see here you see here right yes yeah yeah I hope it is clear now can I move to the second question shyen go ahead sir uh I have a question regarding the addition of new column MH like uh when you are adding the new column e here the value of the column E and F are both dependent on The Columns of the other values right right right so if let's say the let's say we we can assume a scenario when the data this data frame contains some answers of my question here and I'm just importing those answers to my data frame and somehow I miss one column like and now I want to like inter induct the that column but the values in that column are not related to any other column somehow yeah that you can do so what you can do in that case is that let's let's do that use case uh so you have nine values here right so uh let me see let's uh let us have names of the Cities right cities say Mumbai Deli JY Kata Bangalore I'll take the question let's finish this off discussion Hyderabad pun how many of them 3 36 7 okay then say Abad say Okay 3639 okay now what I will do is I will say DF of cities DF I'll just give the column name as City cities sorry this is not working how is printf oh okay that's you can see that city is ADD now right okay like uh like I have to just pass a new uh list right yeah yeah but make sure that that list has exactly the same number of rows as this if you don't do it so regarding that if I somehow Miss some of the values mhm okay so will it be replaced by null or it will show some error it will will do na I guess we will try that okay we'll try that it gave error right it is not matching okay so if you don't have anything right you can just say na it will work okay or something not sure whether this will work it will not work we'll have to we'll have to give proper thing for this again maybe NP na or whatever so this won't work right so you have to mention you have to make sure that the uh the number of entries the lens are matching okay okay someone else have a question yes sir so when we are adding the column so so many places we are proved the data sets so will it be added to that data yes so if you if you basically put it in that data frame then it will be added to that data okay is that uh did I understand your question correctly yes sir yes got okay sometimes you can also copy the data frame and work with it for modification but if you added it to copy if you added to copy it will only be in that copy thing it will not get reflected orig my question is this works for even modifying the original data itself then right yeah yeah so that's huh will it be permanently changing the data frame DS yeah for this execution for this execution yeah because I remember in some cases it doesn't happen like that yeah so generally what you can do is if you want to preserve the original one right you can say that DF copy DF copy or something now you created a copy and everything will happen on the copy the original one will be like that only okay okay uh any other questions so when you are doing DF uh DF newor City you were trying to add the new feature yeah yeah yeah I was trying to add a new city in this but because I had I can I write so I think it will work on the data frame only here you have created the list no see I'm I'm creating a list and I'm pushing all the values that I want to add in the data frame right and then you want to append append a new new city into that I want to append a new column in the data frame um and that column should have values as specified in this list does that make sense right but so what I understand is right now it is not a data frame it's a list this is list you're right but now what I'm trying to do is in this list let's say in this data frame I'm trying to add a new column which is New City and in this new city I'm basically saying that I need the values that are listed in the in this list in that order okay okay but why is it not working time now the length is nine okay I think this will okay all right uh now you can see DF copy City and there is new city right and in the new city you can see that the values are added in the same order so for example this Mumbai is added to the first row Delhi is added to the second row chenn is added to the third row and so on here we don't need do that PD do data frame sorry no no no no so here see here data frame is already created right you are modifying in that data dat frame okay data frame is already created your modifying that data frame okay okay any other questions yeah so we have covered uh most of the basics of the data frame uh man do you think anything is missing Mano are you around yeah hello sir uh sir I'm here but uh I was in another meeting so I no worries no that's okay that's okay uh so do you think anything else is missing so we covered indexing we cover selection we cover how to modify data frame uh do you think anything else we we should be covering dropping a few rows and column yeah we can we can do that that's that's a good one last and so in the last class we tried to do the group by function grou by function yeah we we'll try that also sir here all the entries are somewhere numerical but if the entries are in stream order so how can we just filter them out or selecting them sure so that's a good question so let's take them one by one right so you can say that DF do DF copy copy uh so there's a function called map function so we can actually call that map function and uh then do the same thing right uh sorry interrup what was the question can can can you repeat see he's saying that uh there are numerical values right now um most of the values are numerical but now there are strings how if you want to filter the strings how do you do it so the the very simple thing right that you can do is let's say DF let's say criteria equal to DF copy city right can do very simp simple thing like is in let's say if the city is either bu bangaluru or Hyderabad and now let's say comma will uh take by default or brand no no wait wait wait wait let me let me first work on this and then you can ask questions this is not our condition we are using is in function we're using is in function which is just checking the membership you can see that it is true only in two cases uh did we missed something why only two cases of Bangalore is not matching yeah exactly aha okay that's why okay now it is true in three cases rather we should do the other thing so we should just change the spelling of bangaluru uh C okay first we need to find the criteria right uh DF dot City equal okay just going to try whether this works okay we got this now what I'm going to do is that I'm going to just go to City and going to change it to okay now there's an error why okay we need to put location here L okay now this is copied we'll just check DF copy now we have correct spelling here got it we have correct spell put here sir isn't is a string operation right no this is not a string operation this is a membership checking okay we are simply checking that uh if the value in the city is in this set or not if it is in this set then you you get true else you get false sure so this is only work for single column no you can do it for multiple columns you have to then add uh you will have to basically then uh add and or all those type of things right is this clear now yes or you can also have yeah go ahead s actually I'm looking here you use say City only but if I use new city and Bangalore both both can be changed at a time uh both uh we can try that you are saying saying that you want to change both of them right mhm yes I think that we can try but this won't work now because we have changed both of them not sure whether this will work but we'll try let me see this works yeah it works okay it works both the values will get changed yeah so just do expanation and figure out you can see that okay now I think this is this is interesting this should be new city due to col yeah exactly this worked I'm not sure whether this will work yeah worked okay it's good we will drop that column yeah so now we'll try to draw that column huh yes yes sorry our exploration is bit um half haard see is there drop column function here drop column there should be a draw function I guess okay there is draw function so you can remove rows and columns by specifying label names so we can simply say yeah you can read a documentation and you can also see the code if they have given one you can just you can do DF do drop uh specify the column names and put AIS equal to zero if you want to drop a column if you want to drop a row then change this axis to zero okay all right so we will try H just a minute we will try this and then I'll take your question copy. drop it is this should be like this specify the names of the yeah you can see this right okay now the question what was your question no it's fine good you can see that this is Dro now yes go ahead please sir what is the meaning of x equals to one that's what I said X is equal to one means that you do this operation on the column if you if you say x is equal to zero then that would mean that do this operation on the row okay yeah so you can read more on this uh in this documentation I was pointing out right sir if I don't use access over here just only column name then what will happen I mean uh suppose by default we'll have to check what is the value okay by default ACC is zero AIS is zero so it will conduct a rowwise operation no as you show us example we can give the column name ABCD or row row number is also a b c d so if I say drop a then what will happen I mean either row will go is there any default value or yeah that's what I'm saying right I mean if you don't specify AIS axis by default is zero so you can see that by default the value of AIS is zero so it will it will performed rowwise the operation will performed rowwise okay thank you sir no problem okay any other questions on this okay is there any question on this all right yeah go ahead sir what will we do if we want to like uh change all the entries in City into Chennai can do that very easily uh you can simply say de copy City why this didn't see anything didn't change I'm wondering why should I say go H yeah so yes basically saying that for all rows change the city to Chennai it changed right okay any other questions I think what we did is we did this yeah go ahead please sir sir if the a particular row is to be dropped then that row is to be selected by the row Index right a b c yeah yeah either row index or through some condition okay you can think of condition as a selection criteria right okay all right uh what else we will any other questions you don't have any other questions yes goad this sir uh this just came up to me like uh how can we drop uh several columns let's say let's assume we want to drop the columns uh in which the elements are all string yeah you can write a condition for that you can write a condition for that if the column type is string or whatever right and then you can drop them it has to be in the list right yeah you will have to basically get the list of columns uh which is meeting certain criteria okay then you can do it I'm trying to okay any other questions if there are multiple Columns of the same name then what will happen multiple column s with same name uh we have to see whether it might result into key error or something like that it is not able to recognize the names of the column servers something like Yeah couple of other things we'll do now is you can try to understand the sample function and this will be useful for you uh during some statistical analysis yeah now see what has happened is because earlier I I had just said that EF C it created the it created a row with chenai everywhere so we have to drop this row this is good so we said DF copy dot equal to DF copy do drop now we say now here we'll have to give the uh I don't specify access by default access is zero so you can see that uh we should see that the last row is dropped yeah last row is dropped right so this is again we accidentally uh demonstrated the condition that was ashim was specifying right there is a there a column name City and then there is a row with the name City and now I said drop City without specifing access so since access is zero it dropped the row uh with the label City getting it all right uh now um there is a method called sample so we will check so you can can randomly sample some of the rows the sample takes the number that you want or the fraction then uh whether sampling should be by replacement or Not by default it is not by replacement um then there are ws and there is random State I think the random State parameter is good to we need to set random State parameter so that we get the same answer again and again yeah okay so we will we will try this we simply say DF do copy d. copy let's say uh sorry DF do Dore copy is the name of the data frame do sample we get five samples we got this five samples or let's say just get three samples we got three samples AG G and H we run this again we get three samples we do the different samples G and G A and F G and a are common but if you want the same output right you can say Dore copy dot sample I want to generate three samples and we set random State let say 42 now you go you got is three samples right if you now if you run again you get exactly three samples HB and F so if you want to have uh this certainity um where expent after expent if you want to see the same sample is getting selected set set the random seed or random state to some value okay this ensures that every time you get these three samples the same kind of samples will be returned h okay and also read about this parameter called replacement uh you must have studied uh sampling right in probability class so replacement right whether you allow so replacement replace is allow or disallow sampling of the same row more than once so if you set it to false it will allow sampling of the row more than once if you said it to true then once the row is selected it will not be selected again we can try that also so uh let us not set this now you see we selected okay so here what happens is because of this we said that replace equal to true the same row is getting sampled again okay so here replace equal to true so what we are doing is we are allowing sampling of the same row Again by default it is false so since it is false you always see row getting picked up once by default but you can say that I'm okay to see the same row again then you do replace equal to true you can also do replace equal to True with random on that's not a problem so now hbf will be selected again and again okay I think we have sir you please would you please explain the random State random State equal to 42 yeah you can you can set anything right that's okay okay okay you can set it to any number you can say 99 whatever is your favorite number just put it some number so there will be predictability in your exponation you will see what does it represent random State random state is state is some random seed that is used uh for generating the random numbers for generating the random numbers doing sampling right okay okay yeah so it makees sure whenever we put sampling the same sampling yes yes yes that's correct that's correct instead of shuffling again and again we get the same sample Yeah so basically what happens is that because you're setting this seed right this seed is used to Generate random numbers and since the seed is the same uh you get the same kind of random numbers yeah but sir the seed is Chang then number will be changed right if you change the seat the samples will change uh that sometimes is not desirable let's say you are running some exper right uh and you're showing some result you you let's say reported some results with some samples right next time if you run that same expent without random seed for example the results may change depending on whether the samples have changed or whatever right their results might be slightly different than what you what you presented earlier so if you want to exactly the same repeatability or if you want exactly the same results you need to select exactly the same samples and if you want to select the same samples you always have to set the random State makes makes sense yeah that that makes sense but if the number change then result will be changed right if the number changes results will changes you have to keep the same number yeah okay oh all right I think uh we can stop now uh thank you very much for showing up uh we'll again continue in the next class uh there are certain things like um uh the sampling uh we have done about we talked about sampling we'll talk about group bu and other stuff [Music] okay
