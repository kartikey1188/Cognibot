Let us say we declare n equals 10 a 
variable n and then print the value of n.   The output will be as expected 
as you see the number 10.   Assuming I take another number, let us say r 
equals 6.3 and then print r, obviously it will   print first 10 and then will print r. Now, the 
point is what if I said s equals, please note   sudarshan, and then I will print s as well. 
So, you see what is happening here? 
  Here is a number without any decimal value, 
here is a number with a decimal part.   So, it is not just an integer, it 
is a decimal, it is a fraction,   6.3, and then here this is neither an 
integer nor is it a decimal number like this.   This is a string, a name. I say print s and 
sudarshan gets printed. Now the point is   what we may want to note here is let me 
explain that with an illustration. 
  When I say print type of n, you 
will see what this type does,   you see it says class int, do not worry about 
the, I would say it is a very ugly looking   output, so with less than symbol, greater then 
symbol, the word class and things like that,   but all that it says is it is an integer 
type number in n. What if we said print type   r, executed, it says class float and then, 
so let me just write this for clarity. 
  I will say the type, n is of type, let us say n 
is of type, then I say type r, make sense, r is of   type r. So, mind you the letter n 
here is not a variability, it is just,   I am asking the computer to print the whatever 
is inside the code, this n is not the value   10 here, this is simply the letter n, which for 
reference let me just run this and show you,   it will say n is of type class 
and r is of type class float. 
  And then I say print s is of type, 
type s and I will execute this,   you see what happens, s is of type str, 
we have seen this somewhere before.   So, str is string. What exactly does it mean? What 
is int here, what is float here, what is str here?   You never specified that anywhere here, you went 
ahead and said n equals 10, r equals 6.3, s equals   string sudarshan. 
  But the computer automatically called 
this as int type, integer, called this   float, the word float simply means 
something that is more than an integer,   10.171, now that is a floating point, it is called 
a floating point number. So, in a first course in   computing you will study all these things, I 
am sure you did if not you can always look up,   it is a very easy thing to understand. 
Floating point representation of a number   is the way a computer stores a 
number that is not an integer,   it stores in a very, it is a little too technical 
to get in right now, but just assume from my side   that this is not an integer and if it is not 
an integer, if it is beyond an integer it is   called a float for a computer, it is automatically 
calling it a float and this is called a string.   A computer automatically recognizes the 
type of data that is being stored. 
  Why would anyone want something 
like this? The answer is very simple   if you were to create a vessel where you will 
put your, let us say rice, look at the shape of   the vessel that you use, a jar rather, what kind 
of a jar do you use for rice, what kind of a jar   do you use for, let us say to store some liquid, 
they appear differently. It is not just for the   showy, aesthetics reasons. 
It is it is simply because   the container that holds rice may have 
to ensure that it is free from moisture   whereas a container that that stores water 
you need not to worry about moisture.   So, in a very-very similar way the kind 
of data that you store, your computer does   some work internally in allocating some 
memory location for it to be stored. 
  Now it cannot simply keep the same location for 
all types of data that you may want to store,   be it string or be it floating point or be it 
integer. It is not the same mantra for everything.   The computer recognizes what kind of data you 
are storing and it declares the data type,   this is called data type and it stores the 
values there and says this is the type integer,   I will store it in this way only, details aside 
with time you will understand it, but given that   you are new to programming all that you need 
to know is Python has different data types. 
  So, with this I will end with a small data type 
which will be discussed in detail later though,   but right now I will give you a 
quick glimpse of what this data   type is all about. Let me refresh the screen. 
So, what if I said what if I said, remove this,   l is equal to let us say 10 comma 20 comma 30. 
Please note the format here,   I give a variable name here and say is 
equal to start a big bracket and put   some numbers separated by comma and close 
the bracket that is it and I say print l.   You can guess the obvious, you will see 
this same values being printed here.   And the best part is when you say l of 0 
it displays 10, if you say print l of 1,   0 and 1, it displays the 0th value which is 10,   the first value that is 20. And let 
us say print of l of 2 will be 30. 
  Now, what are we trying to say here? A computer 
always starts naming, assume you go to a   classroom and you start counting people, you 
start with here, this fellow is the first person,   he is the second person, third person, 
fourth person, we humans start with 1, 2, 3,   but a computer generally starts with 0, 1, 2. 
The reason is a little technical we will get there   sometime, but then as of now you please assume 
that a computer always starts with 0, does not   start with 1. The first element here is called the 
zeroth element, then the first element, and then   the second element and so on. So, if I were to 
have more numbers here, let us say 68, 720, 732,   you can put whatever you want, and then you say 
print of l of 3, you will get 10, 20, 30. And then   the l of 3, which is the fourth element here, 
which is 68 and so on, this is called a list. 
  So, let us see print type of l. What kind of data 
is this? Is this the jar that contains rice or   is this a jar that contains a juice or a jar that 
contains sugar? The computer stores this as what?   Class list. It calls it a list. It has a very 
different mechanism, very different way in which   it stores, but that is not important for you right 
now. All you need to know is Python has different   data types. By data types we mean it has a knack 
to store what kind of data in what form. 
  Let us revise whatever we discussed so far, if 
you say n equals 10 this becomes an integer,   if you say r equals some 6.9, it becomes float, 
as I said, let us try printing these things,   print n, print r and then we discussed 
another thing, the last thing was a string,   s equals let us say India and when we 
say print s, this prints the values,   the first one was type, but what we wanted 
was type, so I will change this to type here,   type, and then let us say type. 
And you know the obvious will happen. It is   throwing an error simply because I did not close 
the brackets. Let us try closing the brackets,   now it says the first one is a list, second is 
an int, third is a float, fourth is a string.   So, let me try showing you something 
and leave it as an exercise for you   all to figure out what is happening. 
What will happen if I were to type, type of l of   2? So, let us say print l of 2 and there is a 
print type l of 2, and I delete the rest, I remove   this also. Guess what will happen if I execute 
this. I will execute and show you and I leave   it to you to realize what is happening here. So, 
with this we end this topic of data types. I hope   it is very clear. Do not break your head much. All 
that you need to know is computer has a different   way to handle different types of data that you may 
want to use in your programming show. Thank you!
