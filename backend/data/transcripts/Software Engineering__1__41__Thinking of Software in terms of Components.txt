[Music] we are all familiar with buying things on an online platform like amazon we are familiar with ordering things online and we are not surprised when the goods land up at our doorstep behind it there is a huge system which actually makes this happen so there is the vendor who is putting the things into the system there is a logistics person who is trying to handle ensure that the item reaches you in a timely manner and so on now how do you think this amazon system was built do you think it was built in one monolithic way so in most cases software is not built as a monolithic system but it is built incrementally one feature after the other and moreover often times we do not know at the start what all features are required to be implemented yes that is a good point so we incrementally build certain features into the application and the one the people who built amazon would have also done the same thing and even for building these features software teams have to ensure that they are divided into manageable components so components are a way of breaking the complexity of a system into manageable parts so that different teams can work on different components of the system and put everything together in a timely manner also everyone need not know the workings of all the components as long as i know that if i ask some response from a component and i know what sort of response it will give me that is sufficient for me to proceed with my work so the components can hide the complexity of the implementation and provide an interface to others who want to know what the component does now let us think about the components in the amazon system what do you think are some of the components can take a minute pause here think about what could the components in the amazon system be if you were the one of the developers of that system so i think one major component in the amazon system is of course their inventory management system so they keep track of their inventory in such an intelligent way so learners you might be wondering what do we actually mean by any by intelligent so let's think about what inventory management is so inventory management is the act of measuring the amount location pricing the mix of products available on amazon so when we go to the amazon home page we see that our inventory gets updated based on the current purchasing and seasonal trends and fluctuating customer demand and logistics and analytics also play a large part in inventory management so it is very interesting to see how my amazon home page could be very different from yours the reason being amazon customizes my home page based on my shopping and viewing history another component can be their payment gateway so the payment gateway is another component which offers ease of payment for both buyer and the seller so payment gateway is a service that authorizes the electronic payments like online banking debit cards cash cards etc so the payment gateway acts as a middleman between the bank and the merchant's website or application when a user wishes to make a payment the amazon website sends the encrypted card information to the payment gateway then the payment gateway confirms the validity of these details with the bank and the required amount of money gets transferred from the user's account to the amazon account so we looked at two components of the amazon system the inventory management and the payment gateway i am sure you can think of more components that makes up such a system so in this video we looked at components of a large system such as amazon and we looked a little more closely at two components the inventory management and the payment gateway the main thing that we have learnt is that nobody builds a system all at once for the entire functionality of the system so a system a large system is broken down into components and there are different teams that work on those different components each of these components now is called a module and they can be developed separately and integrated together later of course there is a lot of complexity in doing so because you need these modules to be able to talk to each other and so on and that we will see in the following videos you
