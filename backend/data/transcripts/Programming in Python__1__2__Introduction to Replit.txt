So, let us dive in and write our first program. 
Programming was not as easy as it is in 2021,   thanks to the internet we do not have to install 
anything before starting to code. So, what do you   see? I have now opened my browser, let me just 
zoom in just so that it is clear to you all   and I am typing Replit.com, R-E-P-L-I-T.com. 
And then you will see this. The moment you see   this click on Start coding and then it 
will ask for a user name and password,   if you have a Gmail ID, just click on this G and 
log into your Gmail ID and you will be getting   a window like, a screen like this. 
Go to this plus symbol, click on it,   what is the language that you would 
like to code in, Python obviously,   click on Python and then here you will 
get a name that is machine given. 
  It is generally a combination of words, random 
combination of words. So, what I will do is I will   remove it and then give it a name first code and 
then create on create R-E-P-L. So, I click on it,   this is a repository that gets created. Do not 
break your head about what is a repository,   it is just a place where you can come and code and 
as you can see, you can in fact, see some examples   by clicking here. Let us do that. 
Here are some example codes, but it is   a little confusing to see it on your first day 
of programming. So, let us try coding something   from our hands. Let me say print hello, 
just hello and once I type something here,   you will see things are self-explanatory, 
I will not explain, come here and click on   run and you will see hello here. Now, your 
question would be what just happened? 
  You say something here and the same word came 
here. I mean, what is the big deal? What are we   into? So, the point is this is the place where 
you will type your, you can call it commands,   and this is the place where your computer will 
execute them and show you the result of what you   have typed here. Just in case you typed, instead 
of hello you typed Namaste, and then click on run,   it will show you Namaste. 
If you say Namaste India   and then click on run, it will show Namaste India 
, so the nutshell all you do is you type your   commands here and you get the output here. You can 
type more print commands, this is the second line   and you will indeed get Namaste India in the first 
line and then this is the second line . You can   type whatever you want, put dots here or put some 
special symbols and you will see them here. 
  Let us do a small piece of code that is not 
simply printing some English statements. Let me   delete this and simply type one star, see what 
happens, let me not explain what I am doing,   it again should be self-explanatory. 
So, what am I doing? I type two stars   in the second line, three stars in the third 
line, as I run this I will get this. 
  We keep doing this assuming I have a lot of time 
this evening, I can keep typing, this five lines   and then sixth line is six stars, 
seventh line is seven stars.   Then run, you will get precisely what you have 
typed. It is sort of has a staircase effect as   you can see, correct? And let me continue this 
8, 9 and 10. Looking at the pattern you see,   I should have included 9 stars here, but I have 
included 2 stars more, making it 10 stars. 
  If I run look at this the computer will 
obviously not know that it should display   the 9 stars here and not 10, simply because you 
have specified 10 stars here. The point to note   is that your computer does precisely what you ask 
your computer to do. If you ask it to display a   hash at the end, it will simply display a hash 
at the end as you can see. Print I don't know   what to type , then run it, it will simply say, 
I don't know what to type as simple as that. 
  So, this is a gentle introduction, 
a very quick introduction to   Python and the simplest way to start 
typing your code and the simplest code is,   of course, your print statement. I 
just now showed you how you can type   something here and execute the same by clicking 
on run command and the executed code appears on   the screen right here. This should be enough to 
begin with, you can go ahead and try exploring   whatever you want to explore. 
Before I conclude let me try to display this stars   in the reverse order. What do I mean by that? 
three stars, let us say space space star,   give me a minute, you will understand what I am 
trying to do, space star star and star star star.   What do you think this will display? Exactly the 
same thing but in the reverse order. Wonderful!   Now, what if I want to display four 
lines? Understand a small issue here. 
  I cannot simply put four here. I 
should put one space extra here,   one extra space here and one extra space 
here, do you see, do you see that I   clicked on run and I got the output, a 
beautiful staircase effect, but in the   staircase effect, but in the reverse direction. 
But do you observe something? It is not as easy   as the previous program where you simply typed one 
star in the first line, two in the second line,   three in the third line, fourth in the fourth 
line, it is a little more involved than that. 
  To make your life even more difficult, rather 
I am making my life difficult here, not yours.   I am sure when you type start typing your piece 
of code your life will become difficult as well.   You see for five I should again go 
and push these things by one space   run and here I am. And assuming I did that for 
about 10 lines and the 11th line will involve me   going up and then putting space to all the lines 
above, oh, it is going to be some hard work if   you are going to do this for like 20 lines. 
I stop here with a question - Is there any way we   can automate this? Of course, we are a couple of 
weeks ahead with this question, rather I am asking   this question couple of weeks ahead, but let us 
wait and watch if there is a nice way to display   this by coding something really nice here, in 
just three to four lines, so let us wait for the   forthcoming weeks where we take you on our 
journey of automating things using programming.
