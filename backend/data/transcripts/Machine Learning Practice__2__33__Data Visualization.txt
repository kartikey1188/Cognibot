Namaste welcome to the next video of machine 
learning practice course. In this video we   will study the next step of end-to-end machine 
learning project that is data visualization.   Data visualization is performed on training 
set and in case of large training set   we usually sample examples to form an exploration 
set. Data visualization enables us to understand   the features and the relationship among 
themselves and with the output label.
  In our case since we have a small amount 
of trading data will use all of it for   data exploration. In this case there is no 
need to create a separate exploration set.   It is a good idea to create a copy of 
the training set so, that we can freely   manipulate it without worrying about any 
manipulation in the original data. 
  So, there are different visualization 
techniques that we can use the first one   is the scatter visualization. So, we can use the 
cbone library for doing the scatter visualization   and there is a scatter plot function in 
the library that we can use. You have to   predict we have to specify the the x-axis and the 
y-axis and the the data for for visualization.   So, the scatter plot prints the data in form 
of such a graph where we have fixed acidity   on the x axis and density on the y axis.
And each point over here is a training point   and each point has been assigned a colour 
based on the quality of the wine.
  Another library that we can use is 
matplotlib for the same purpose.   In matplotlib we can we can show the same kind 
of data with with slightly different look at   fill as well as you know by using some kind of a 
colour coded strip for denoting the quality.
  Apart from visualizing individual features we can 
also study relationship between features. One of   the relationship is a standard correlation 
coefficient. It ranges between -1 to +1   correlation of +1 denotes a very strong positive 
correlation between the features correlation of -1   denotes a very strong negative correlation between 
the features and correlation of 0 means that there   is no linear correlation between the features.
We can visualize correlation with a heat map.   So, note that note that standard 
correlation coefficient only captures   the linear relationship between the features. 
If you suspect or if you believe that there is   a non-linear relationship between the features 
you can use rank correlation for that purpose.   Let us calculate correlation between our features. 
We can use core function for calculating the   correlations between the feature.
Let us check out the features that are   correlated with the label and in our case 
the label is the quality of the wine.   So, you can see that. So, if i if i plot this 
correlation matrix with respect to the label   these are correlation of 
different features with the label.   You can see that sulfates is a sulfate 
has correlation coefficient of 0.22   alcohol has correlation coefficient coefficient 
of 0.48 which is probably the strongly correlated   features with the quality of the wine.
Whereas volatile acidity is probably the   strong negative negatively correlated 
features with the quality of the wine. 
  We can visualize the correlation matrix with heat 
map. So, there is a heat map function in cbond   library that we can use for that purpose. 
So, here you can see all correlation coefficients   in one go in form of a heat map. So, what you 
see is this heat map which is some kind of a   symmetric matrix there are there are features 
on y-axis and then there are features also   in the x-axis and what you see is each cell 
calculates correlation between the features.   So, here you can see that fixed acidity 
and citric acid are are strongly correlated   with correlation coefficient of 0.66.
And you know you can see the colour coding that   we have used for representing this correlation 
on the side on this colour bar here on the side.   As we move towards correlation of wine the colour 
becomes fender and fender and as we move towards   a smaller or lower correlation 
the colour becomes darker.   In this way you can quickly spot 
strongly positively correlated features   as well as negatively correlated features. 
So, these are some of the examples of negatively   correlated features for example fixed acidity 
and pH s are negatively correlated. 
  So, you can notice that the correlation 
coefficient on diagonal is one. The darker colors   represent negative correlations while ventricular 
denote positive correlations. For example citric   acid and fixed acidity have strong positive 
correlation with correlation coefficient of 0.66.   pH and fixed acidity have strong negative 
correlation which is correlation of -0.67.   Another option to visualize the relationship 
between the features is with scatter matrix.
  So, there is a scatter matrix function in in 
pandas plotting library that we can use. So,   scatter matrix function also plots 
the relationship between features   in form of scatter scatter plots. On 
diagonal you see some kind of histograms   they denote the distribution of the individual 
feature. For example this particular histogram   shows the show that shows the distribution of 
the citric acid feature. Whereas this particular   scatter plot shows the relationship between citric 
acid and pH so, this is a scatter plot of citric   acid pH versus citric acid and so on.
For the convenience of visualization   we are showing only a small number of 
attributes on the screen otherwise this   would have been a very large plot which cannot 
be accommodated on this particular screen. 
  So, similar analysis can be carried out 
with combined features, features that   are derived from the original features.
There is a small note of wisdom for all of you   visualization and data exploration do not have 
to be absolutely thorough. The objective here   is to get quick insight into the features and its 
relationship with other features and the labels.   Exploration is an iterative process once we build 
the model we obtain more insights and we can come   back to the exploration step if necessary. That 
is all from the data visualization visualization   process. In the next step we will look at how 
to prepare the data for the training.
