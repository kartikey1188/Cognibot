Here we are concluding week 2. I hope you people 
enjoyed the most important parts of Python the   syntax per se, beyond this we will be covering 
this syntax very quickly and we will be talking   only about programs. The first two three weeks 
we will be talking a lot about the construction   of the language, the grammar of the language, if 
I may, so things are slightly less interesting,   but it will get more interesting with time.
But I am sure in week 2, you saw some interesting   aspects as well. You saw how do you declare 
variables, the bucket s example that I started   off with in the introduction session of week 2. 
You saw the if loop, how powerful it was, you   even wrote a program for Caesar Cipher, the Cipher 
that takes, the idea that takes text and shifts   it by a few units and then it looks garbled.
Nobody can make the sense of what the text is,   but then if you shift it back, it starts making 
sense and we did a piece of code to do this. So,   and then we went ahead and saw some string related 
details, very basic ones though, strings are very,   very powerful entities in Python and we will be 
discussing more of it with time, but as of now   you are now confident about handling strings.
And finally and very importantly, we did discuss   about this import possibility in Python and I 
told you a good example, a good analogy would   be going to a library and getting books as in when 
it is required and not storing all the books that   you would ever require in your life in your home. 
You will run out of storage space obviously. 
  So what you do is, you get as in when it is 
required and that is precisely what the import   functionality does in Python, you say import 
random, it brings in the library functions from   this book so called book called the function 
called the random, it is actually a library   function. Once you get that, it means that you 
have the entire access to all the functions from   this random library and the world is yours.
If you do not include it, you do not have access   to those libraries, as simple as that. So 
we introduced you to the random function;   the math library function and I am sure 
you are comfortable using these library   functions, there are tons and tons of library 
functions, some of them are built into Python,   some of them are external, you need to install 
that on your computer and start coding. 
  You want to analyze Facebook data, you want to 
analyze Twitter data, you want to analyze let   us say Covid statistics; there are library 
functions exclusively meant for this things   and we will probably see some of them during the 
course. I hope you have enjoyed the second week,   there is more to come from third week 
onwards. In fact, third week will   the crux of the syntax in Python, let us wait 
and watch what is coming next. Thank you.
