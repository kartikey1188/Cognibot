[Music] and I hope all of you are familiar with collab and how to work with collab so if you're not familiar I will quickly show you in a minute what is collab so if you type cab. research.com you will get a front end something like this uh so this is a collabor front end so what happens is that when you connect you get a virtual machine somewhere in the cloud which has most of the packages related to machine learning uh pre-installed so you have a zero configuration start for your work you don't have to worry about setting up your machine with required packages libraries and things like that so once you connect you get that virtual machine and when you get that virtual machine uh once you get that virtual machine um what you see here is a web front end and collab is very interesting because uh you can write documentation as well as write code so there are concepts of uh two types of cells one is called code cell where you can write code uh so let's say I say print hello world and you can execute it you can either press this play button or um type shift control shift enter okay so this is a code cell uh then there is text you can write some documentation like this this is my first experience with collab right and you can you know there are you can make this bold uh you can apply various uh styles on your writing and basically this is uh in the the language called markdown so if you write a markdown here so for example I can type an equation litic equation Y is equal to W1 w0+ w0 + W1 X1 so you can see that this particular thing got converted into a nice looking mathematical equation right so this is written in markdown format or uh specifically in J format uh which is also included in markdown or you can have a list here you can say the f is the list I can write list of items list item one item two I can also have sub items here sub item one sub item two and so on plus you can add pictures you can add links there various things that you can do with this Texel which is quite Rich because uh you know as you're writing you can also explain what is the uh what program you you're writing right so if you go to this collab right by default um the file that opens up it has got bunch of tutorials there is over overview of collaboratory there is uh markdown guide you should uh you know uh check these things out okay then uh you know today we are going to talk about uh introduction to uh pandas and uh by the way there is very nice uh material about pandas here there is a collab on pandas so you can also check that out so this is a super quick uh tutorial on pandas so you can you can also check this out if you interested yeah so there are a bunch of useful tutorials uh whatever is relevant go through them uh no need to go through all of them but you can see some of the uh some of the interesting tutorials here for example there is [Music] a say there is a voice swapping tutorial so you can you can see that this is a tutorial on swapping voices and you can see the code right there are some code cells then there are some Tex cells where there is some useful description about what's happening um yeah so over the time in this course you will be writing uh some such nice collabs and collab is a preferred interface uh so there is a open source version of collab which is called Jupiter notebooks uh which is also which has got equivalent functionalities like collab if you feel like using Jupiter notebooks feel free to use them as well okay all right I'll quickly take questions because we talked a bit about collab now okay uh okay is everybody able to see the screen now all right uh is everyone able to see collab uh okay all right uh great so perfect so we'll move forward and we'll go to pandas now okay so what I have done is yes yes sushmita go ahead go ahead with your question I think so it was a mistake all right no worries okay um so what I have done here is I have also created a collaboratory or collab uh this class and what I will be doing is I will be walking you through um you know some of the pandas functionality through through this collab okay so I have filled in initial part of the collab and rest of the collab is pretty much empty and we'll be filling it up as um as we progress in this session okay uh so pandas it's important to note that uh is a column oriented data analysis API okay so information is stored column wise in pandas and uh pandas is a great tool for handling and analyzing the data and there are many machine learning Frameworks that support uh Panda's data structure as input that's why it's important to understand how pandas work uh so this is again not a comprehensive introduction to pandas because pandas is huge Library so for a complete reference I would um request you to refer to Panda's doc site I will show you that particular page as well so this is Panda's documentation uh so you can there are user guides there are getting started guides there are so many useful references here so feel free to U refer to this but what I will do in this class is I cover basic functionalities of pandas that will be useful for you to get started with pandas and also give you glimpse of uh what are machine learning specific functionalities uh that are of our interest okay so first of all uh you know before we start we need to import the library uh you know that because all of you know about pandas and since pandas is a library uh I'm going to uh put it in a different font so let's import pandas so you can import pandas as import pandas as PD so I'm using this short form so it's easier for me to later refer to these pandas libraries I will refer to at PD and I can simply print a version of the panda Library So currently uh this collaboratory has uh Panda's version 1.5.3 um included it may happen that collab is using slightly older version of pandas uh but whatever we are going to cover here will be applicable for the newer version setp okay pandas is implemented um with two data structures mainly one is data frame uh data frame you can think of it as a relational table with rows and columns and second uh second data structure is Series right series is a single column and that column has a name so each row in pandas is labeled via an index so that could be an integer index or we might label that row with any other textual identifier that is fine and a data frame consists of one or more serieses and there is a name for each series okay and data frame is commonly used for abstraction for data manipulation so let's straight away uh you know uh look at a pandas data frame and for that what I will do is I will use uh a data set from a skill Lear library and that data set is basically diabetes data set and the way we can import this diabet diabetes data set is we have loore diabetes class in escalan do data sets module so we will simply say from Escalon do data sets import loore diabetes and we can simply call this loore diabetes with as stream equal to true as an argument and when you say as stream equal to two true this particular function returns us uh a data set which is stored in form of a data frame if you set this to false we basically get a bunch object um and since we are interested in uh talking about pandas data frame or pandas um I'm I have said this ascore Frame equal to True okay uh we have covered this particular method in detail in escal data set so we will not be spending a lot of time uh on this particular uh code cell just understand that we are going to uh load one of the um one of the pre-built data set in skar uh for us to understand how pandas and the data frame uh Works in general so now what I will do is I will run this you can see that uh we have diabetes data which is of type data frame so what we'll do is we'll say that DF is equal to depes data okay uh now uh this is is one way in which you can load data in data frame there are many other ways in which you can construct data frames um which might be useful for you in several other cases so we will we'll see one more way of uh creating a data frame okay so this time what we'll do is we will do it from uh we'll do it from maybe series okay uh so give me a minute so we create uh a series for example so we say so let's let's write a title creating Bas data frame from cies so let's say we have cities and population so we say PD do cities let's say we put names of some of the Cities let's say Mumbai Bangalore Chennai and let's say you want to also store populations of these population I'm going to make up some numbers I don't know exactly the populations of the cities or we can ask Google just to see just to make it real okay it is 17 million wow Chennai is 6 million and Bor is 13 million wow okay so we say 17 million 13 million and 6 million so what we have done is we have created two series two series objects one is for cities and second is for population and now we are going to construct a data frame from these two series objects so what we'll do is we'll say PD dot data frame and then we have a dictionary we create a dictionary and we can give we can use keys right dictionary keys for key City we store City series and for the key population we store the population series okay and we'll see whether this works okay so you can see that we have created a data frame let's give it a name City info data frame and you can get type of City info data frame you can see that this is Panda's data frame we can simply print this C in dat yeah so you can see that there are three entries here in in the cities and three entries in the population and you can see that uh there is one to one correspondence the first entry in the population series is assigned to the first city second to the Second City and so on so you can also do this let's say I have four city as Delhi but I don't know its population so I can still use this but for Delhi we'll get not a number or not available right the one because we have not entered anything here so it assigned an N here got it so this is another way in which you can create a data frame so there are many methods that are supported in in pandas where you can read CSV files you can read text files you can read Json files you can read Excel files and you can create data frame directly getting it any questions now on the data frame creation part any questions all right so that was about how you can create the data frames okay now let's say you read such kind of data frames and you want to really know what is there in these data frames so we'll go back to our uh diabetes data set and we'll explore uh the data in that okay yes narima morti you have a question uh yeah uh so you mentioned that uh we can load data from files and correct different ways right yeah if I have a very large file let's say 4 five GB file mhm then will data fa be able to handle it or it depends on the memory on the machine in the machine memory memory on the machine is definitely one of the important uh parameter here data frames can handle large amount of data uh provided you have memory available on the machine okay thank you no problem thank you for the question a Gupta hello hi um I would like to ask like why did we even create dat data frames weren't series or dictionaries good enough that's a good question uh so you can always work with series and dictionaries that's not a problem but then you will have to uh Implement lot more functionality that data frames or pandas has uh already created so uh because of this data frame so a lot of machine learning algorithms that are already implemented uh use data frame uh as input uh to the algorithms so that's why it's important for us to uh study data frames and understand than yeah thank you yeah and uh that's a good point so we can also spend some time on this so if you use Panda's data frames right your code will be lean you don't have to write a lot of code uh to execute the same functionality right so that's another reason why we are interested in studying this that's a good question thank you very much okay uh so let's try to understand uh explore data in [Music] pandas
