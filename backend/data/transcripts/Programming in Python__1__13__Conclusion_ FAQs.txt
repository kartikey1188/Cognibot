I hope you enjoyed coding with us as and 
always coding involves practice as we have   been stressing, programming involves you to code 
very frequently as much as possible and not just   code whatever, we tried coding the terminal, 
you probably were parallely coding but it is   also important that you code a little more 
than what we have tried coding this week,   that is the only way in which you 
will get comfortable with programming.  So, here we are, we will address a few 
frequently asked questions rather concerns   that a student who is trying to program or 
learn programming for the first time faces,   although python is very-very-very programmer 
friendly, I did not mean to exaggerate it,   indeed is the most programmer friendly language 
that I am aware of from my little experience   of programming from the past 15 - 20 years.
I find Python really-really easy to understand,   I wish python was there, was the first 
programming language that I learned,   unfortunately it was not. So, here are some 
questions which I will go one by one. Feel free   to ask your questions on the forum in case you 
have more questions than what we have addressed.  I cannot remember the syntax, I find it difficult 
to remember several keywords that Python requires,   this is the question. So, to address this, yes, 
I am with you people. Of course, it is going to   be difficult, in fact, Python is a lot more than 
what one can understand, maybe even in a lifetime,   I mean, so is any programming language, but then 
try to see the analogy with any other language,   look at your own mother tongue.
Do you know all the words in your   mother tongue or you do you think your vocabulary 
is full in the sense that there is no word left   out? Obviously not, but then you are aware of 
most of the words, which is enough for you to   converse in your day-to-day life. Similarly, 
as with Python it is enough if you learn a few   things, I mean, which will help you open 
up the world of possibilities eventually.  But then as you are learning these 
few things you will stumble upon   the exact syntax, I mean, you will, you would not 
know how to write a piece of code for instance we   discussed strings, there were a few functions that 
we used, there were a few keywords that we used   to sort of manipulate strings. It was 
not very easy for us to remember them.  I mean, but then with time you 
will start remembering them   and you always have internet to look up, you 
can even have a small cheat code, I mean,   the cheat book, cheat sheet that you can 
keep so that you can write down all the   syntax that is frequently used and then look 
them up as often as it is required, but then   in an actual you need not worry, this is a 
very-very frequently occurring problem, everybody   complains that it is too much to remember, 
but with time you will start remembering it.  I get errors when I am programming and I find them 
very irritating – So, everybody does get errors,   even people who are very proficient with 
programming tend to miss out a few things when   they are coding. Syntax errors are very common as 
you saw, in a simple print statement if you miss   out on closing the bracket it throws up an error.
This is very common, you should get used to it,   nobody is a perfect programmer and you will indeed 
make errors here and there. And Python, in fact,   helps you by telling you what exactly 
is the error there, not always though,   but most of the times you will get to know where 
you are making an error and you can rectify it   immediately. So, to answer your question this 
is completely normal, you should get used to it.  A programmer's life involves fixing the errors 
more than writing the code, so this is how a   programmer's life is and you are entering into the 
world of programming, so you should get used to   not getting upset with errors. Why are we 
learning Python why not any other language   xyz? That is a good question. Of course, 
we are free to teach or learn any language,   but then the reason as we stated.
The reason why we took Python is that Python is   very easy to learn, easy on the mind for a person 
who is trying to program for the first time,   very powerful, much sought after, the entire world 
today is talking in the language of Python and   most of the jobs are open for python 
programmers in my humble observation.  And most importantly I would say if I 
were to restart, I mean if I were to   start my student hood and assuming I did not know 
programming, I would definitely start with Python,   for a simple reason that most of the open source 
softwares today, assuming you want to do something   creative and you need to look up if someone has 
done that already, mostly that program will be   in Python, it will not be in any other language.
This is my observation. So, which means that if   you learn Python, you have millions and millions 
of open source projects available for you,   millions and millions of library functions readily 
available for you to pick and then simply use.   That is probably the reason why we thought python 
would be a good programming language to start.  But then one is free to learn any other 
programming language, but the point is   once you learn one programming language, 
trying to learn a second programming language   is not very difficult, it is just like learning 
a second language, first language as an infant,   you and me probably found it very difficult, it 
took a long time, but then an immediate second   language was not really very difficult.
So, once you learn Python for instance,   if you do not know C or C plus plus, you 
learn Python really well, start coding,   understand what is logical thinking, how to, what 
is programming logic and eventually you will see   that learning C and C plus plus is only a matter 
of knowing the equivalent syntax in that language,   which you have already learned.
So, Python that way gets you started as   a beginner. I do not think that it is easier for 
one to learn a programming language like Pascal   or C or C plus plus, Python is relatively easier, 
that is the reason why we thought one should learn   Python and that is the reason why we are teaching 
you all Python as the first programming language.  How do I efficiently learn coding? How do 
I get better at coding? So, the answer to   this is as and always how do I get better with 
a sport, let us say table tennis or chess or   let us say badminton, the answer has always 
been practice makes one perfect. So, you may   want to practice as obvious as it can get.
But then while practicing there are few   tips that we can give you. Number 
one is it is important for one to   type a piece of code for a particular question 
repeatedly, that is one skill that I think   would come very handy for a beginner wherein just 
in case you are given a question to let us say   sort a few numbers, you will be 
seeing these programs eventually,   although we did not cover it in the first week.
You will be seeing sorting of numbers is,   something that is taught in the first few days of 
programming, you will see that sorting numbers,   writing a piece of code can actually be 
daunting for a beginner, but then once   you finish writing the code, you should not 
move to the next program in my humble opinion,   you should open the browser, open the compiler 
and open the editor and then type the code afresh.  You should repeatedly do a code for the same 
question multiple times, I mean, of course,   by not looking up the code that you typed already, 
but assuming that you have forgotten the code you   should try redoing it. This is a very nice way in 
learning how to get good at coding for a beginner,   especially the reason is the following.
The reason is we address the question   of syntax, remembering the syntax, when you are 
typing a piece of code there are two things that   makes your life difficult, one is the syntax, 
remembering them and second thing is the   logic itself. First one you will get used to 
with time, you will understand what is what,   you will understand Python keywords and 
you will be proficient with programming,   but then logic it is very question dependent.
You also will learn logic with time,   logical thinking also comes with time, once, it is 
like seasoning your mind, you will do it slowly,   but then the first one, the syntax is 
actually memory based comes with time,   but logic takes more time for one to learn. 
But when you do the same piece of question,   same question multiple times, you will, number 
one, you will not worry about the syntax,   number two, you will worry only about the logic.
That is the reason why you want to solve the same   problem multiple times. So, how do we go about 
it? Take a question, try writing a piece of code   and then open the editor once again and do it once 
more and do it three or four times and try to take   a program that is slightly longish, I mean, you 
do not want to do a two line code multiple times,   it does not make sense. This is a good way in 
which you can get good at programming with time.
