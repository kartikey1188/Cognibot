Hello python students. In previous lecture we discussed about import
statement and we also saw how to import a particular library into python program. In that same lecture we also talked about
two python libraries; math and random. We will introduce one more library called
calendar and using that library we will discuss the main concept of this particular lecture
which is different ways to import a library into a python program. Let us start with calendar library. Import calendar, print calendar dot month,
let us say I want to display the calendar of 2021 and month let us say January. Let us execute and see what output we are
getting. It displays the entire calendar of month January
2021. Similarly, you can change the month from Jan
to let us say July and execute it again, it will display the calendar of month July. You can always change these values for year
and for month to get a calendar of that particular month of that particular year. But what if I do not want to display a calendar
of only one month, let us say I want to display calendar of entire year 2021. Of course that is possible, let us see how
to do that. Print calendar dot calendar in bracket 2021,
let me comment this line and let us execute the code, as you can see the entire calendar
of year 2021 is displayed over here. Now you must be wondering why it says calendar
dot calendar, now do not break your head over this particular way of writing the code, we
will come to these concepts slowly in later weeks of this particular course. Right now let us focus on different ways of
input statement. So far we have imported the library calendar
and used two different features of that particular library, first allows us to print a calendar
for a month and second one allows us to print the calendar for entire year. So far we have discussed only about this kind
of a import statement. Let us try another variation of this particular
import statement. Let me remove this line. From calendar import star, print calendar
2021, let me comment this code, we all know how to comment a multiline code. Let us execute this, as expected we are getting
the output where the computer is printing the calendar for entire year 2021. You must be wondering what is the difference
between the earlier code and this new code? Earlier we were writing import calendar, then
we say import calendar brings the entire library calendar into this python program and anything
inside that library can be accessed only through this particular word calendar. Due to which we always have to write calendar
dot calendar or calendar dot month as we saw earlier. But in second case, when we said from calendar
import star, which means we are telling the computer to bring everything inside the calendar
library into this particular python program. Due to which now we do not have to write calendar
dot calendar, we can directly access this particular feature called calendar and pass
the value for year as 2021. Same thing can be done for month as well,
let us see month 2021 and 10th as a month October. We are getting October month of 2021. Once again we did not write calendar dot month,
we only wrote month, because as I explained earlier, in first case we are telling computer
to bring the entire library called calendar into python program whereas in second case,
we are asking computer to bring everything inside that calendar library into this python
program. Due to which now computer knows that there
is something called as month in that particular library. Let us execute a similar code with the first
type of import statement; import calendar, print month in bracket 2011 comma 10. It says name error, name month is not defined,
as I explained currently computer is able to find that there is a library called calendar. What all things are there inside that library
are not known to the computer. That is the reason we explicitly have to mention
calendar dot month. Now come to the knowns, it should look for
the specific term month inside library calendar. Then it should be able to execute the code. Once again just to summarize, import calendar
statement imports the entire calendar library in this particular python program, whereas
from calendar import star, imports the entire content of calendar library into this particular
python program. Now we will see the third variation of this
particular import statement. Let us comment this code first. As I explained earlier, in this case we are
importing the entire content of library calendar into this particular program. But ultimately we are using only one feature
of that library which is month. In this case, do not you think it is not an
optimum way where we are importing everything, but using only one feature of the library? Unnecessarily we are asking computer to bring
all those things, but we are using only one feature out of all those things, hence to
avoid all that trouble, we will simply say from calendar import month. Still we will get the same output. Only problem with this kind of import statement
is now if we try to execute something like calendar 2021, then it will not execute, it
will say name calendar is not defined. Because we explicitly said from calendar import
month. So now computer will bring only month feature
from calendar library into this program. In this case, we explicitly have to mention
month comma calendar. Now both those features month as well as calendar
will be available in this particular program. Hence we got the output first the month October,
because of first print statement and then the entire calendar of year 2021 to second
print statement. If we are using one or two features from a
specific library, then this is the most ideal way to write the program. And if you are using almost all the features
of the library, then it is better to use star like we saw earlier. Output will always be same, moving on to the
next and the last type of import statement. In which we can import a specific library
or a specific feature of the library and store it in a variable. Let us see how that works with import calendar
first. Import calendar as, this is one more key word
says as let us say c. Now the entire calendar library is accessible
using this particular variable c. We can say c dot month and the specific month
which is October of 2021 will be displayed. This particular feature helps us in saving
some time writing some lengthy library names. Same thing can be done using the next type
of import statement as well. We can say from calendar import month as let
us m, let us remove this line and in this case, instead of month we can use this variable
m. Because now computer knows that this particular
calendar library has a feature month and it is stored in variable m. Let us execute, October 2021. Before closing let us revise what all things
we saw in this particular lecture. First we saw a normal import calendar statement,
then we saw something where we used from calendar import star, then we saw from calendar import
a specific feature either it can be a month or calendar or something else. And then we saw how to store a specific feature
in a variable or a library itself in a variable using a key word as . All these different types of import statements
are not that critical, we are teaching you all these concepts to complete the python
course. As a python programmer, you should know that
there are multiple ways to import a library. Thank you for watching this lecture. Happy learning!
