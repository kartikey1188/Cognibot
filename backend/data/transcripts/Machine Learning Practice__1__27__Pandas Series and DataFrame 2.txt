[Music] okay uh so let's try to so it would be useful to uh see what is there right um let's see quickly examine a few entries in the data frame say first five and last five for example so there are redent functionalities for that so we can say DF do head so by default you will see first five entries okay by default you see first five entries in in the data frame and in the same way if you say DF dot you'll get last five entries okay and if you in general do not know anything about these functions there is a very nice facility here where you can put a question mark before this and enter okay y hit generally documentation should show up not sure why it is not coming sir can you try head after question mark after the head uh it doesn't work that way doesn't work that way question mark has to be in the front now you can type DF head without the bra let's check ah good thanks so you can see uh this function so this is a very useful functionality um so whenever you want to know more about a particular function you can just put a question mark uh followed by question mark you should have the name of the function and then you can read um you know what the what are the arguments in the function what the function is doing in this case you can see that the function returns first n rows for the object based on the position and the default value of n that is set here is five that's why you see the you see first five rows and python documentation is very standard in the doc string uh the first line that you see here is generally one line description of the function which gives you the gist of what is happening so you can see that it Returns the first n rows and since this n right the argument here is U the default value that is used is five we see the first five rows and then there is a detailed description okay yeah and you can then see what are the parameters what are the return types so here the parameter is n and uh it returns first n rows okay and then there is data frame. T see also it returns last n rows you can modify this n right you can set this n to 10 and you will start seeing first 10 rows getting it so but if you do not give any argument the default argument comes into picture and you see the first five rows the same way you can change the number of parameters in tell and do last let's say three rows okay so uh yeah so here we learned about head and tell for quickly examining the data just to glance to the data we have not really done anything but we just want to see what is there in the data frame okay I can see lot of questions sir sir is there any parameter that I can see the all of the datas by using he. yeah yeah yeah you can see all of the data but it will be very hard for you to understand what's happening here right um You can simply put DF and you should be able to see all of the data no no actually by using head or tail uh with head or tail right so if you uh so there are 442 par 442 I guess uh the number of Records right so you just say Nal to 443 you'll be able to see all the all of [Music] them please mute yourself okay so you can see that I used any equal to 44 443 so you know it gave us all the rows whatever is in the data okay but if you want to really know how many rows are there in the data frame you can actually use a function called shape or sorry not a function really the attribute of the data frame you can say DF do shape and you can see that there are 442 rows and 10 columns and where DF is defined there was some question DF was defined over here okay okay thank you sir I understood now you can just do Nal to 442 or Nal to 442 you will able to see all of the data but we generally don't do that okay typically we just say DF do head and DF dot okay I'll write text here find out the number of rows and columns in the data frame right so in this case in this case there are 442 rows and 10 columns any other questions sir uh I watched the previous year lectures and I tried for this do shape and do head but for the breast cancer data didn't work so does it have any type of data it works and it it does not or so uh so is your data in data frame that's the first question you you should check whether your the type of the data is data frame it will work only if your data is in data frame format okay maybe that's a mistake so by default uh by default if you use the load breast cancer function it loads it in the form of bunch object on Bunch object these uh these attributes or functions would w't be available okay maybe that's the mistake yes yeah thank you sir no problem okay any other questions yeah so specifically note that we are since we want to get the data in data frame format we have set as frame equal to true and because of that we are able to load the data in the form of uh data frame so to use all these things we have to do convert to data frame right yeah yeah we have to basically load the data in form of cre data frame which which is very easy there is a uh there is a parameter in this function called asore frame set it to true thank you sir and then uh there is a then you get a dictionary and in that dictionary there is a key called data on that data there will be a data frame that will be present so you just uh extract that and start working with it okay all right so sometimes you may be curious right what are the column names so you can also see the names of the column uh let's see the names of the columns so yeah let us do that so you can simply use columns attribute d. columns and you can see the 10 columns that are here you can easily convert that into a list format by saying list DF do columns you will get it in this format there are these 10 columns so we know H SE BMI BP uh we do not know what these columns mean so you will have to probably lead uh read the load diabetes description for that so we can say load diabetes so you should get used to uh this type of work it is very hard for anyone to remember all the functions so uh you should take help of documentation in order to understand uh what the data is all about even here we do not see the description of the data set what what are those columns you might have to go to the load diabetes page diabetes data set so this is a diabetes data set and here I'm hoping to find the names okay yeah uh you can see here there are 11 columns BMI is body mass index BP is average blood pressure S1 is total serum cholesterol S2 is low density lipoprotein S3 is high density lipoproteins S4 is total cholesterol by HDL S5 is possibly log of serum track deside levels and S6 is blood sugar level these are those S1 to S6 parameters okay yes these methods work for tabular data sets um but it's important that you load them in form of data frames then these methods will work [Music] yes that is another way in which you can try you can do DCR on Diabetes data set and you should be able to see the um yeah that's a good good point okay yeah there is DSC on this so you can [Music] see yeah all this is part of the data set exploration class you can check it later yeah so you can do pretty print on this you can just print this able to see yeah all good okay uh so these are those 10 columns so it's important to understand what those what those uh what these columns are and typically you have to work with domain experts if you're solving a real world problem to understand um the meaning of the columns in the data okay all right so if you want some more statistics some some more information about um what is there in the each of the column you can simply call the info function on the data frame and this info function will tell you uh many things about what is there in the data frame so you can see that there are 10 columns how many entries are there overall there are 442 entries and they are indexed from 0 to 441 so what happens is that every row also has an index an index can be a number or it could be any other descriptive attribute you can put a text string also uh so here it is in form of number so it's the range index going from 0 to 441 and there are 10 columns and we just saw these 10 what are these 10 columns you can see that there are 442 non-null entries in these 10 columns so there are no entry with a null value okay so you can see quickly so this sta itics will tell you um whether there are any null values in your data sets right and you can also see what are the data types of these columns so these are all float columns okay and you can also see how much memory uh this data frame is occupying it is just taking 34.7 KBS of memory getting it so this info uh function on the data frame is very useful to get quick glance of the summary statistics on the data set okay all right go ahead please ask a question yeah uh it's SC sir so here it say the data type is float 64 right I just want to understand how did data frame know that it needs to use float 64 um this is by default uh the data will be loaded in FL 64 format okay yeah and is there a way in which we can specify the data type for a column so for example if I have a date data type uhuh can I specify that I want a particular series to be loaded as a date yeah in a certain format you can do that you can do that uh and data frame can have heterogeneous columns so some column can be in text some columns can be in date format that is all allowed that's not a problem okay yeah I I mean I'm asking this question purely because we just completed the the dbms course and all right I see yeah yeah yeah trying to see if there are parallels there yeah there yeah so think of data frame more like a relational table right so just like in relational table you can have different Columns of different types you can also have uh Columns of different types here in the in the data frame but but I guess the differen is here you in the beginning you mentioned that it is a in the comment it was there column colum store something it's a column store yes it's a colum oriented it's a column oriented store yes so there it is different because then typically rdbms tables are row store right right right but there are also column uh column store rdbms that I mean column store databases that are also available yes yes I think Google bit query is one of them yeah okay thank you okay okay any other questions all right uh let's move on then sometimes you also want to know um the quick statistics on the on the data that is stored in the in the data frame so for that we have a method called describe let's use that let's get sumary statistics under data frame we say DF do describe yeah now you can see uh in the describe what happens is that it selects all numerical columns and the numerical columns are summarized if you have any non-numerical columns here the description uh simply ignores them so we have to do something else for non-numerical columns uh in the data frame but since you have all all of the columns are numerical here you will see 10 different columns and for each of the column we get count how many how many rows are there in each of the column what is the mean value what is the standard deviation what is the minimum value what is the max maximum value and then you get 25 percentile 50 percentile and 75 percentile okay so you can use this information to quickly figure out whether there are any outliers in the data so if you 75th percentile and Max are are far apart then you can see that there are some outliers over here in the same manner if your minimum value on 25 percentile is far away then you can also say that there are some outliers in this particular region okay so this information will be very useful to figure out whether your data has any outliers and by default it shows 25th 50th and 75th percentile you can also change this uh you can also change this to some other other ranges let's say um 20 30 and 60 for example right or 2050 and 70 so you can simply um You can call DF describe and you can put we can say percentiles we can say percentiles and give a list say 20th percentile 68 percenti and 88 percenti yeah you see 20 50 60 80 right yeah by default it gives 50 58% all right so this is how you can quickly see uh the the summary statistics of the data frame so typically in Real World what we do is we do the describe de to describe and we transpose it so that it is slightly more readable so now what has happened is the rows have become column so now you can read it row by row you can read the entire statistic summary statistics of a column in a row rowwise format some people find it uh easier to read okay uh I'll just quickly take questions if you want to count specific classes in Target variable what do you mean could you please elaborate a bit Rina I didn't really follow your question so maybe you can uh try to write it in slightly more elaborated format uh I will come back to this yes anant go ahead good afternoon yeah well I see that this uh mean of the age column is actually showing some negative number to^ minus 19 what it might mean uh that could be because the data is in normalized format they might have normalized data that's a good um yeah data might have been normalized oh okay okay fine thank you because of which [Music] okay
