Try observing this program. I say print hello,   type in your name . Remember in the previous 
case I said type a number , enter a number   and now I am saying type in your name . What 
exactly was the previous code? I said n equals   int input and so on. That was because it was 
a number. We told the computer that the number   that is being input the, whatever the user is 
trying to input it is actually an integer. 
  If you were to type in your name it will be a 
string. So, you should put str and then input   and then go to the next line, this may 
sound a little confusing, I must warn you,   but do not worry as we keep using it more 
and more, it will get very, you will get   very used to it. And then I will say print n and 
so let us execute this and see what happens. 
  Hello, type in your name, Sudarshan and 
then you see the first one was what I typed,   second one was what it displayed because of the 
print statement here. I can go ahead and say   hello comma n, to execute this   type Sudarshan, it says hello Sudharshan 
. You can of course, continue and say   and it will indeed say, hello, how are you?  
Look at this Sudarshan, hello Sudarshan how are   you? Wonderful! So, you are slowly getting a 
hang of what is programming and how we can, so   what is unique about this program? What is unique 
about this program is that whatever you enter,   it says hello to that string that is being 
entered. And I am trying to make it really   interactive although this may sound really 
dumb, what is so special about a program   saying, hello Sudarshan how are you. 
But then you can think of the complexities   that one can add to this. I will just try 
to include just one complexity to this.   I will say, type in your name, and take a 
string, then you say which place are you in?   delete this, which means I am supposed to 
enter the place here, it will again be the same   p equals str input. 
Please note, why did I say p? I say p here   because you have n here, which stands for your 
name, if you put n here assume you put n here,   then the name that you typed in which gets stored 
in n, will be lost, because this is the bucket,   in which you stored your name and then your 
place also is being stored there. You probably   are wondering why cannot it store both? 
That is not how the computer reads it. So, without   any further explanation, let us see what exactly 
this does? Hello type in your name, Sudarshan,   which place are you in? I am now in Mysore. 
It does not display anything simply because   I have not displayed anything here. So, look 
at what I would want this program to tell me,   it should say hello, name, and 
then how is the weather in p?  
  I make it one level more interactive here 
if you compare this with the previous code.   Let me execute it, it says, hello, 
type in your name . I say Sudarshan,   it says, which place are you in, I say 
Mysore, there seems to be a problem somewhere.   Let us figure out what is the problem? p is 
not defined, you see I made a mistake here,   n should be p, without declaring 
something if you simply use it this   is the kind of error that you will encounter. 
In fact, we have not edited any of these errors   that we get while we are coding that is because 
the mistakes that we make you may also make,   so we do not want to appear very perfect, so any 
mistake that happens here will be corrected here   and the video will not be edited, you will be 
seeing why the error came and you will be careful   enough to reverse the error in case 
you encounter a similar error. 
  Now let us go ahead redo this, Sudarshan 
is my name, what place are you in,   Mysore, it says Hello Sudarshan, 
how is the weather in Mysore?   Perfect, very nice! Now, if I were to rerun 
this program and instead of my name I type   Amitabh, as an Amitabh Bachchan, which place 
is Amitabh right now? I am hoping he is not,   given the Covid situation he 
probably is at home. So, let me   type what am I typing, let me type Mumbai. 
Hello Amitabh, how is the weather in Mumbai.   So, it is not grammatically correct, how is the 
weather in p, I should probably put a question   mark after this, so hello, type in your name, I am 
the, let us say it is the Prime Minister of India.   Which place are you in? New Delhi. Hello, 
PM, how is the weather in New Delhi? 
  So, you can make it even more complex here. 
You can make it display the right way, you see   there is a small problem here, there is a space in 
between New Delhi and question mark, you probably   are wondering how to remove that space, you can 
think of using something called format specifier,   which is coming next. But I am just giving 
it as a puzzle try to look up online how this   can be removed and then try to remove it. 
Most of these things are available on Google,   just type it and you will have a question 
on some forum, which addresses exactly this   question and you get an answer as well. That is 
with variables, we will go ahead and study more   variables right now. You understood that n was a 
string, p was a string, I will go ahead and say   what is your age? You see this will be an 
integer. Let me say age equals integer input. 
  We execute this. Hello, type 
in your name, Sudarshan,   how is the weather in, which 
place are you in, Mysore,   hello, how is the weather in Mysore, by the 
way what is your age? I will say my age is 90.   That is it. It is not saying 
anything. So, I will say   good to know you are, age, years old. So, you 
can guess what is going to happen now. 
  Sudarshan, which place are you in, Mysore, what 
is your age, let me call myself a teenager and   feel good about it, I say 15. Good to know 
you are 15 years old, says the computer.   Point to note here, you can use print statement 
and include variables there instead of telling   you what exactly is variables, explaining 
it in detail, I simply used it in a program   and made you feel comfortable about 
how variables are being used. 
  Not only did I use the variable here, I used the 
variable and assigned a value to it by using a, I   mean, making use of the input statement, whenever 
you say input, it will ask for the input, it will   convert that to, the type that you have specified, 
int type and then assign that to the variable.
