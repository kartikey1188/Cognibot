foreign [Music] we looked at requirement Gathering and Analysis and we also looked at how we need to consider the primary secondary and tertiary users of a system now that we have identified these different types of users the question is now how do we gather or identify requirements from these users do we just talk to users or are there other ways to gather these requirements so let's reflect on this question for a moment and let's take the example of the Amazon Seller portal that we looked at in the previous video let's say that it's the early days of Amazon and you have been commissioned by Amazon to build this Amazon Seller portal so here are some of the users that we identified in the previous lectures so we have independent sellers we have a sales team or a sales manager of different companies we we have people from the advertising Department we have Logistics or shipping company managers of course we have buyers and we have Banks so the these are different users of the system so now the question is what are ways in which we can gather requirements from these different users for developing a seller port you can pause this video and think about these answers before proceeding so there are different requirement collection techniques and let's look at them one by one so one type of requirement collection technique is what is known as a questionnaire so questionnaire is nothing but a series of questions which are designed to elicit specific information from users and I'm sure most of you would be familiar with questionnaires as you would have filled such question as as part of you know different courses and the program as well and these questions can be of different types can be a simple yes or no question maybe you have to choose from a set of answers or it can be a longer response or a comment and questionnaires are good for getting answers to specific questions from a large group of people who are usually spread across a wide geographical area so for example you can send questionnaires to sales team managers of several mobile companies and you can ask them questions like you know what percentage of your inventory do you sell online or you know what are main difficulties you encounter in selling your product online so these answers to these specific questions can help us elicit requirements from different users and an important thing to note is that this should be used in conjunction with other techniques other requirement Gathering techniques which we'll see in the next slide so another important requirement Gathering technique is interviews right and interviews it involves asking someone a set of questions it is often face to face but it need not be we can use telephonic interviews or even online interviews to ask questions and interviews are broadly classified as structured unstructured or semi-structured interviews depending on how rigorously the interviewer sticks to a prepared set of questions so an interview can be structured which is nothing but a fixed set of questions and the interviewer asks those questions and elicit responses and in an in an unstructured interview the interviewer doesn't really know what type of questions to ask because they don't know what the user does or what exactly their needs are so in such cases we can ask users broad questions and based on their responses we can probe further into specific aspects so what are purposes of these interviews one is we it helps us get or understand issues which people have and it can be used early in the requirement Gathering process to elicit different scenarios so for example we can conduct interviews with independent Sellers and ask them you know what are different platforms which you use to sell your products this is a fairly open-ended question and they might give answers like we use WhatsApp Instagram and then we can probe them and ask you know what are disadvantages or advantages of these portals and they might say well I get customers you know it's easy to get customers but then tracking orders you know tracking payments tracking my inventory what are different selling options all of this is a huge overhead right so from from these questions we can elicit requirements which involve tracking orders you know tracking payments and all of these things so now we looked at interviews and one drawback of interviews is that it offers only one perspective and an alternative can be to get a group of stakeholders to discuss issues and requirements and the the advantages of using focus groups are one is it helps us gain consensus so if different groups of stakeholders if they highlight the same issue or the same concern then we know that this is a key requirement which we need to build into our system and this is also useful for highlighting areas of conflict or disagreement so different groups of people might not agree and this helps us get a nuanced understanding of the needs of different stakeholders so let's take an example from the Amazon Seller portal itself so we can conduct focus groups with you know different sales team Managers from different verticals and there might be different expectations from different Industries so for example a mobile sales team might be very interested in understanding what is the sales summary at the launch of a particular mobile whereas departments like furniture they might be more interested in the sales summary of the last 30 days so from such focus groups we can elicit requirements like such as the summary of the sales in the past X days or in a specific day so these are some requirements which can be elicited from focus groups so in the previous requirement Gathering techniques we looked at interviews focus groups in these techniques we are asking people questions but one thing to remember is that what people say is often different from what they do and it is very difficult for humans to actually explain what they do or describe accurately how they do a particular task so for example how do buyers buy online what are they looking for in a product this might not be very easy to articulate and hence an important technique which we can use is observe users right it involves spending time with stakeholders as they go about doing their day-to-day tasks and observing their work in their natural setting and this involves you know shadowing a stakeholder making notes occasionally asking them questions but primarily observing what they do so let's take the example of a seller the seller portal so one way in which we can gather requirements is to look at how people sell in physical shops so for example shopkeepers or customers they give recommendations the customer might ask the shopkeeper for a new product and or the shopkeeper might ask the customer to try a new product customer feedback is also very important the shop owner they appreciate feedback about a product which they sold to their custom so these can be translated into the online setting as well in the form of recommendations as well as getting timely customer feedback another type of requirement Gathering technique is documentation so there are places where you know which helps several procedures and rules for doing a particular task and these might be written down in manuals or documents or there might be steps which are involved in performing in an activity or there might be regulations which might be governing a task so in our case in case of a seller portal Bank regulations are an important requirement to consider so for example how can you add sellers bank accounts to your portal or how frequently can you deposit money to seller accounts what are practices of other online marketplaces all these can be gathered from different documents or different procedures and regulations so here's a summary of the requirement Gathering techniques which we saw till now so we looked at question as interviews focus groups observations and documentations and each of them serve a specific purpose for example questionnaires are good for answering specific questions and interviews are good for exploring issues and for which we do not really have the answers for focus groups are important for collecting multiple viewpoints and observations are good for understanding the context in which a user performs a particular task and then we looked at documentation which involves procedures regulations and standards so we looked at several requirement Gathering techniques and using thought experiments on how we can gather requirements we were able to identify several requirements for the Amazon seller put for example we understood that a catalog and inventory are necessary and it is essential for us to track different things like orders payments the sales as well as customer feedback so to conclude let us look at some basic requirement Gathering guidelines so first we need to focus on identifying stakeholders needs and we need to involve all the stakeholder groups the primary secondary as well as the tertiary users because each of these types of users have different needs and requirements and it is advisable to use a combination of different requirement Gathering techniques mainly because different techniques have different purposes and we need to use them according to our needs another important point to consider is to run a pilot session if possible to ensure that your data Gathering session is likely to go as planned many a times especially for questionnaires you might miss out on a particular question you might have wrong options might be having missing options so it is difficult to go back and ask users to fill the survey again and hence it's important to test your Gathering techniques before you actually go about and gather requirements and finally data Gathering is expensive and it is time consuming because you have to talk to different types of users and once you get their responses you need to analyze them and all of this is a time consuming and effort consuming activity and hence often at times we have to be pragmatic and we have to make certain complexes
