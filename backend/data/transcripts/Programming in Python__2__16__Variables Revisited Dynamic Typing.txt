Let us say, I declare the variable A as 10 and 
then print its type; if you remember, type prints,   what kind of variable A is. It is saying integer. 
So I need to tell you people that what we are   discussing right now is not very important for 
a beginner. But then for completeness sake,   we need to tell you these things. So do not 
worry much in case you do not understand this   really well right now, but eventually you will, 
I mean as we reach eighth week, ninth week,   you may want to go back and then look at what 
are all we discussed so far and then try to see   if things make sense to you or not. 
So, this is slightly advanced, but do not   worry if you do not understand, but make your 
of attempts to understand what I am saying.   So I say A equals 10 and I print the 
type of A and now I say A equals India   and then print the type of a. So what is your 
guess? Initially, it was int, now it became str.   Remember, we were discussing 
about the jar in your kitchen. 
  You can use the jar to store rice or maybe even 
water for that matter, but then we specialize in   our, in the containers that we use for storage, 
we do not use the same container that is used   to store rice, we do not use that to store 
milk. Milk container looks different, is made   of a different material and things like that. 
So similarly, a computer tries to store an integer   type using a different kind of memory location 
and string in a different kind of memory location.   Moment you say equals 10, 
it automatically creates,   what does it do? It creates a particular data 
type. By data type, I mean the memory location   where it, where the value of A is stored and the 
moment you say A equals India, of course, it loses   the value of 10 that it was initially assigned 
to, but then it becomes of the type string.
  This is this goes by the name dynamic 
typing, you all know what is commenting   right now. I use comment; the first line will be 
dedicated to write what program we are writing.   We are trying to illustrate what we call the 
dynamic typing. The word typing here does   not mean the typing of the keyboard. The word 
typing here is the noun form of the word type.   Dynamic stands for things can change. 
In Python, the moment you declare an integer,   it does not stay as an integer; you can change 
A to whatever you want. It provides flexibility   for you to use a variable for something as a, as 
an integer and then make it a string later on.   The type of a variable is dynamic; you can change 
it as per your wish. So let me remove this and   then illustrate this with a better example. 
Let me take a number n equals 10 and then say n   equals n by 2. Carefully observe what happens 
here. I print the type of n and as you would   expect, it is int only. Let me clear the 
screen here. Clear clears the screen.   So let me print. It shows you it is of type 
int. n is of type int is what it is saying. 
  Now, let me print another print statement here and 
display the type of n. Now after I divide by 2,   let us see what it does. It says int, but 
the moment you divide, it becomes float.   So let me try printing and now and says it is 
5.0 now, but then here, if I were to print n   it is, it says 10. It does not say 10.0. 
But the moment you divide by 2 it,   the moment division happens, it realizes that 
oh now the integer might become a non-integer;   it can become a rational number or some real 
number. So, let me be careful. Let me allocate,   let me deallocate that integer. Let me try to 
allocate something that that is easier for me   to contain this object; it could be a real number. 
So I will use float, float stands for real numbers   and in the language of computers, int is integers 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5; float is 4.3, 7.61 all that comes   under float. So let us see what happens? 
What does Python do even if we divide by 1,   even if we divide the moment you use the 
division operator, Python makes the number,   makes the variable float from it being int. So it 
changes irrespective of you assigning explicitly   you did not do n equals a string, you just divided 
n by 1, still Python was intelligent enough to now   change the type to float thinking that 
oh, this chap is doing some division,   he may continue to do more division. Let me try 
making it float to be on the safer side. 
  This goes with the name dynamic typing, again as 
I repeat not very important at this stage. Just   know it for completeness sake; we are trying to 
teach you this. But in case you do not understand   you know what to do you go ahead with other 
weeks, confidently but and then come back and   then try to look at these things, this will make 
more sense once you start coding extensively.
