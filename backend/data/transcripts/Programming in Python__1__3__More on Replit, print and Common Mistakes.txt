Hello Python students. In this lecture we will see 
some more features of Replit and print command.   Also we will see some common mistakes one may do 
while writing a Python program. Let us start with   the different features of Replit. If you observe 
the left side panel, you will see various icons   available over here. Each icon represent a 
different feature of Replit. Let us first   focus on this first icon, which is files . 
Inside files you can see there are two different   options at the top called add file and add 
folder . These two options will allow you to   manage your programs in more systematic 
way. For example, we can add a new file.   Let us name it new program dot py . You can always 
go back to the previous file or you can write in   your newly created file. Similarly, we can also 
create one folder. Let us call it week 1. 
  Also we can organize these files by simply 
dragging them inside week 1 folder. So,   inside week 1, we have new program dot py as 
you can see over here at the top. Similarly,   we can keep adding such files in a folder or 
outside the folder. This particular feature of   Replit allows us to create multiple programs 
and organize them in a systematic manner. 
  Next it has many features like version 
control, packages, home secrets, settings,   databases, unit tests. But 
for now we will explore only   one part of it, which is settings . 
So, if you go to settings the first is   layout, the default layout is side by side, but we 
can always change it to stacked. It will bring the   place where we write the program at the top 
whereas the console where we see the output   at the bottom. Also it has two different themes, 
which is light or it can be dark. Similarly,   we can change the font size and so on. 
There is one more interesting feature   which you all must explore, which is this 
last option code intelligence . Let us see   the difference between disabled and enabled code 
intelligence feature. Let me type print command   currently it is not showing any information 
regarding this particular command. 
  Let us enable this code intelligence 
feature and retype this print command.   If you observe, we are getting 
various different options   and it also provides the detailed information of 
this particular print command. We will explore all   these options in detail as we go on, but for 
now you can read this information, which will   help you to understand this particular command. 
These many features of Replit are sufficient   for now. Let us move to Python program. 
If you remember in last lecture you have studied   a print command where you print something like 
this hello India and executed the program.   Now, I have one question for all of you - Is it 
necessary to print only one string at a time?   What if I want to print hello India as well 
as hello world in a single print statement?   Can we do that? Definitely, it is 
possible, we can write two different   strings or two different messages in the 
same print command separated by comma,   hello world .  
Let us execute this,   as you can see it is possible to print different 
messages using a simple print statement separated   by comma. Similarly, we can add one more command 
as well, hi Python students . As you can see it   is printing all three messages one after the 
another in that same order, which means the   order is very important. The first message gets 
printed first, the second message appears next   to it and then the third message and so on. 
So, print is pretty flexible with respect to this   where we can print one message at a time or 
it also allows us to print multiple messages.   Let us ask one more question - Is it 
necessary to print only messages over here   or can we print some numbers as 
well? What if I write something like   print 10, what will happen if I write print 
10? It prints the number 10 as it is. 
  Which indicates that it is not necessary that we 
only have to type messages using letters from a   to z, we can also print numbers using print. 
Now, you all must be thinking is it necessary   to print only whole numbers or can we print 
fractional numbers as well. Let us try it 20.5.   Let us execute, yes, we can we can print 
strings, we can print whole numbers or we   can print fractional numbers using print. 
Now the next obvious question arises is can   we combine all these three things together? 
Let us try that, let us replace this with 10   and this with 20.5. Let us remove 
this. Let us try to execute,   yes, we can hello india , 10, 20.5. 
So, we can conclude that print command   can be used to print multiple messages 
or multiple values at the same time.   Also it allows us to print string whole numbers 
as well as fractional numbers together. 
  Now, let us look into the second part of 
this particular lecture, which is some common   mistakes which you may do while writing the python 
program even with as simple statement as print.   Let us look into those common mistakes. Print, 
first the spelling of word print might be wrong,   which is kind of obvious, but the next part 
is more critical, you may think all brackets   are same, but when it comes to programming 
each bracket has a specific meaning. 
  Usually after print, we use a round bracket. 
Now, is it necessary to use round bracket   or can we use some other type of a 
bracket. Let us try it square bracket,   hi, it shows an error message, which 
means square bracket is not allowed.   Let us try a curly bracket, still an error 
message. Let us try angular brackets,   again error message, which means in Python, 
along with print we must use round brackets. 
  We always type whatever message we want 
to print in these single quotes. Is it   necessary to have these quotes? Let us try, error 
message, which means the quotes are required.   Now, the next question is is it necessary to have 
single quotes or can we use double quotes as well,   like this? What do you think whether the 
program will execute or it will not? 
  Let us try, it executes, which means Python is 
very strict when it comes to brackets, but it   is very flexible when it comes to these quotes. We 
can use double quotes or we can use single quotes   both works correctly, only requirement is if 
you open double quotes, then you must close with   double quotes and if you open single quotes then 
you must close with single quotes. A combination   of single and double quotes will not work. 
All these various constraints of a language is   generally referred as syntax, which defines how 
a particular code has to be written in a specific   language. Thank you for watching 
this lecture. Happy learning!
