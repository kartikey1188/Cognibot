Eligibility to write end term exam: Average of the best 5 out of the first 7 weekly assessments scores >= 40/100 and attending at least one of the 2 quizzes in the centre


Eligibility to get final course grade:

Attending the End sem exam AND scoring a minimum of 35% in the OPE (overall) AND Getting the question based on Python-DB connectivity correct is mandatory to get the course grade.

(The OPE will be based on SQL query(Week 2-3) and Python-Database connectivity(Week 7).)

If you don't get the 35% in OPE OR don't pass the Python-DB connectivity question, you will be given Fail in the OPE.)


OPPE:

There is only one OPPE conducted for the course at the end of 8-9 weeks. But there are 2 chances to attempt it.

 Students have to mandatorily attend the OPPE on the first date. If you fail in this, you get a chance to reappear the next weekend. So you get 2 chances to attempt the exam.
If you are absent on the first date, you do not get the reattempt chance.
If the first date is inconvenient due to a clash with some other engagement, then you can apply for a postponement to the second date providing sufficient proof. If this is accepted, your exam will be moved to the second date but if you fail in this, you will not get another chance to reattempt. You will have to do it in the subsequent term.

The calculation of Final course Score is proposed as follows:

           GAA1 = Average score in First 10 weekly graded assignments

        GAA2= Average score of week 2 and 3 SQL based assignments

        GAA3= Average score of week 7 programming assignment

        Qz1 = score in Quiz I (0, if not attempted)

        Qz2 = score in Quiz II (0, if not attempted)

            OPE1 - Score in online remote proctored programming exam

        F = score in final exam

Overall score for eligible students:

T = 0.04GAA1 + 0.03GAA2 + 0.03GAA3 + 0.2OP + max (0.45F+0.15max(Qz1, Qz2),  0.4F+(0.10Qz1+0.20Qz2 ))

App Dev1 project is a corequisite for App Dev2 Theory.

App Dev2 Theory is a corequisite for App Dev2 Project.

MLP course is a co-requisite for MLP project.

BDM course is a co-requisite for BDM project.


There will be fortnightly assessments configured in the MLP project course alone that you have to submit. We will be using this information to cross check your engagement in the course.

2. If theory is completed in September 2024 or earlier and project completed in Jan 2025: Project will be evaluated on 105 marks until 15th March 2025. For submissions beyond this, project will be evaluated out of 100 marks.

BDM project will be evaluated only out of 100 marks for all students, irrespective of the term submitted in.

Each project has its own modalities and processes to be followed.

Please check your course announcements for the project timelines and make the submissions accordingly.

Timelines (Appdev1, Appdev2 & MLP, BDM projects):
Here are the timelines for students doing projects in the January 2025 terms who will be entering Degree level in the Jan 2025 term. Without completing the 12 courses and 4 projects, you cannot start degree level courses from Jan 2025 onwards.

For entering the Degree level in May 2025, you have  to complete ALL projects and vivas by March 2025. `

BDM project final submission has to be done and approved by Feb/March 2025 so that viva can be over in March/April 2025. Project grade for all the courses will be pushed on/before April th.


Very important:

Viva policies

Viva planner - Jan 2025 term-MLP
Viva planner - Jan 2025 - Appdev  

Students who completed App dev1, App dev2, MLP and BDM in Sep 2021/Jan 2022 terms:

If you complete the 6 courses and 2 projects of any of the two Diploma, you will get the Diploma certificates. But your credits will not be 27 for this Diploma but 23 or 25 depending on how many of these courses were completed in these 2 terms. The projects done as part of the courses of Sep 2021/Jan 2022 will not get the 2 credits. So there is no issue with the Diploma level.


When you come to the BSc level, 114 credits are required to obtain the BSc certificate. Hence this deficit of 2/4/6/8 credits will have to be made up by taking more elective courses offered by the IITM BS program.

Degree Level courses
Level of the course: 

The first digit of the 4 digits given in the course code represents the level of the course. Eg: CT is CS1001 is a 1 level course.

Deep Learning CS3004 is a 3 level course.

Industry 4.0 MS4001 is a 4 level course.


BSc level:

It is now mandatory that students have to complete both the core pairs and SPG in the BSc level. Credits = 20

All 8 credits can be earned from IITM BS courses or NPTEL (maximum upto 4 credits from Table 2) or if there is an option to credit campus courses (IITM or other institutes), that too can be done.

This will be implemented wef Sep 2023 for the batch that enters the degree level in Sep 2023.


BS level:

2 courses in the level 4 or higher should be mandatorily completed in each of the BP and BD categories. Please refer course category in table1

Out of the remaining 12 credits, it is MANDATORY to earn 4 credits in the HS/MG category. HS/MG can come from inhouse electives or from NPTEL-Table 3.

Remaining credits are from any of the other in-house/campus electives or Apprenticeship electives.


Apprenticeship:

Apprenticeship is completely optional. Students can also complete the BS level by just doing only course work.
