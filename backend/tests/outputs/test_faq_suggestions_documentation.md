### ***Case:*** *Successful FAQ suggestion retrieval*

**Request Method:** `GET`  

**Inputs:**
```json
lecture_id: 22
```

**Expected Output:**
```
HTTP Status Code: 200 and field 'faq_suggestions' in JSON
```

**Actual Output:**
```
HTTP Status Code: 200
JSON: {"lecture_id": 22, "faq_suggestions": "The students' questions reveal a significant focus on one key concept: nesting `if-else` statements within loops.  Since \"Can the if-else statements be used inside of loops?\" is asked repeatedly (five times), it should be the primary focus of your proactive addressing.\n\nHere's a comprehensive strategy to address these student questions proactively in future sessions:\n\n**1.  Addressing the Frequent Question (\"Can if-else statements be used inside loops?\"):**\n\n* **Begin with a clear and concise \"yes.\"**  Don't beat around the bush.  This establishes the core answer immediately.\n* **Provide a simple, illustrative example:** Show a code snippet demonstrating a `for` loop (or `while` loop) containing an `if-else` statement.  Keep it short, focused, and easily understandable.  For example:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(10):\n    if i % 2 == 0:\n        print(f\"{i} is even\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{i} is odd\")\n```\n\n* **Explain the logic and flow:**  Step through the example line by line, explaining how the loop iterates and how the `if-else` statement modifies the behavior within each iteration.  Visual aids (like a flowchart) can be incredibly helpful here.\n* **Expand on use cases:** Discuss practical scenarios where this nesting is useful.  Examples might include:\n    * Processing elements in a list conditionally.\n    * Implementing search algorithms.\n    * Controlling program flow based on data within a loop.\n* **Address potential misconceptions:**  Some students might struggle to visualize the nested execution.  Explicitly address this by highlighting that the `if-else` block executes *for each iteration* of the loop.\n\n**2. Addressing the Less Frequent Question (\"Do we actually need to use if-else statements in all codes?\"):**\n\n* **Answer with a definitive \"no.\"**  Many programs don't require conditional logic.\n* **Provide examples:** Show simple programs that don't use `if-else` statements\u2014perhaps a program that just calculates a sum or prints a sequence of numbers.\n* **Explain the purpose of `if-else`:** Emphasize that `if-else` statements are tools for *controlling program flow* based on conditions.  They are used when the program's behavior needs to change based on different inputs or situations.  They are not mandatory for all programs.\n\n**3. Proactive Teaching Strategies:**\n\n* **Preemptive introduction:** In your lecture *before* introducing loops, briefly mention the possibility of nesting control structures like `if-else` inside loops. This creates a mental framework for students.\n* **Incorporate examples throughout:** Don't just present the concept in isolation.  Integrate nested `if-else` statements into many different examples throughout your lectures on loops and conditional statements.\n* **Encourage questions:** Create a safe and welcoming classroom environment where students feel comfortable asking questions, even if they seem basic.\n* **Use diverse examples:**  Show examples with different types of loops (for, while) and different types of conditions.  This will help students grasp the broader applicability of the concept.\n\n\nBy focusing on the most frequent question and incorporating these proactive teaching strategies, you can significantly reduce future confusion and enhance student understanding."}
