### ***Case:*** *Successful lecture review report generation*

**Request Method:** `POST`  

**Inputs:**
```json
{
  "course_id": 1,
  "week": 1
}
```

**Expected Output:**
```
HTTP Status Code: 200 and JSON with 'lecture_review_report'
```

**Actual Output:**
```
HTTP Status Code: 200
JSON: {"course_id": 1, "week": 1, "lecture_review_report": "**Common Issues:**\n\n* **Clarity and Examples:**  Students consistently mention a lack of clarity and request more examples to illustrate concepts.  This is evident in the feedback for Lecture 3 (\"nothing was clear\") and implicitly in the audio issue impacting understanding in Lecture 2.\n* **Audio Quality:**  Poor audio quality was specifically mentioned in Lecture 2's feedback.\n* **Pace:**  Lecture 1 was considered good but too slow. This suggests a need to balance pacing to cater to different learning styles.\n\n\n**Suggested Improvements:**\n\n* **Incorporate More Examples:**  The instructor should include more diverse and relevant examples in lectures to improve understanding and engagement.  Consider using real-world applications, case studies, and visual aids to illustrate key concepts.\n* **Improve Audio Quality:**  Check microphone quality and settings before lectures.  Consider using a higher-quality microphone and ensuring proper room acoustics to minimize background noise and improve audio clarity.  If recording lectures, invest in audio editing software to improve post-production sound.\n* **Optimize Lecture Pace:**  Find a balance between a pace that allows for thorough explanation and one that maintains student engagement. Vary the pace throughout the lecture, using different teaching methods to cater to diverse learning styles. Consider incorporating interactive elements like short quizzes or discussions to break up longer explanations.  Solicit feedback on pacing during lectures.\n* **Seek Regular Feedback:** Implement a system for collecting and acting upon student feedback throughout the course, not just at the end. This could involve brief in-class polls, online feedback forms, or short anonymous surveys after each lecture.\n\n\n**Overall Student Satisfaction:**\n\nStudent satisfaction appears somewhat mixed. While two lectures received a 4/5 rating, indicating a generally positive experience, one lecture received a significantly lower 2/5 rating, highlighting a considerable issue with clarity and examples.  This suggests that while some aspects of the lectures are well-received, significant improvements are needed to ensure consistent quality and student engagement across all lectures.  The average rating is 3.33/5, indicating room for substantial improvement."}
