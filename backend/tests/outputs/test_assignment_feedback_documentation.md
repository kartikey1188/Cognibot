### ***Case:*** *Successful execution and feedback generation*

**Request Method:** `POST`  

**Inputs:**
```json
{
  "user_id": 1,
  "code": "def greet(name):\n    print(f'Hello, {name}')\n\ngreet('World')"
}
```

**Expected Output:**
```
HTTP Status Code: 200 and JSON with 'execution_result' and 'feedback'
```

**Actual Output:**
```
HTTP Status Code: 200
JSON: {"execution_result": "Hello, World", "error": null, "feedback": "- **Errors Found:**  No apparent syntax, indentation, or runtime errors are present in the provided code snippet.  However, the code lacks robustness and flexibility which could lead to issues with different inputs or usage contexts.\n\n\n- **Suggested Improvements:** The function currently only prints to the console. Consider exploring ways to make the function more versatile, perhaps allowing it to return a value instead of solely printing.  The handling of the input `name` could be improved to gracefully handle unexpected input types or empty strings.\n\n\n- **Best Practices:**  While functional, the code could benefit from more descriptive variable names if a more complex application were to use it.  Adding docstrings to explain the function's purpose and parameters would enhance readability and maintainability, especially in larger projects.  Consider using more robust input validation to ensure the function handles various scenarios gracefully."}
```

**Result:** `Success`

### ***Case:*** *Code with syntax error (missing colon)*

**Request Method:** `POST`  

**Inputs:**
```json
{
  "user_id": 2,
  "code": "def add(a, b)\n    return a + b\n\nprint(add(5, 3))"
}
```

**Expected Output:**
```
HTTP Status Code: 200 and JSON with 'error' and 'feedback'
```

**Actual Output:**
```
HTTP Status Code: 200
JSON: {"execution_result": "", "error": {"type": "SyntaxError", "message": "expected ':' (<string>, line 1)"}, "feedback": "- **Errors Found:**\n\nThe code contains a syntax error related to the function definition and a potential indentation error.  The `return` statement's placement relative to the function definition is crucial and needs to be carefully examined.  Additionally, a missing colon after the function definition's parameter list is a clear syntax error that prevents execution.\n\n\n- **Suggested Improvements:**\n\nThe function definition should be reviewed to ensure the correct syntax for defining a function in Python.  Pay close attention to the placement of the `return` statement and the use of colons to properly delimit code blocks. The use of consistent and appropriate indentation is vital for Python code readability and execution.  Consider adding docstrings to clearly explain the function's purpose and parameters.\n\n\n- **Best Practices:**\n\nUsing a consistent indentation style (e.g., 4 spaces) throughout the code improves readability.  Adding a docstring to the `add` function would enhance its understandability and maintainability.  Employing meaningful variable names would further improve the clarity of the code. Consider adding basic input validation to handle potential errors or unexpected input types.  Finally,  more comprehensive testing would help identify potential issues earlier in the development process."}

**Result:** `Success`

### ***Case:*** *Empty code submission*

**Request Method:** `POST`  

**Inputs:**
```json
{
  "user_id": 3,
  "code": ""
}
```

**Expected Output:**
```
HTTP Status Code: 400 and error message
```

**Actual Output:**
```
HTTP Status Code: 400
JSON: {"error": "Code cannot be empty"}
```

**Result:** `Success`

---

### ***Case:*** *Missing required field: user_id*

**Request Method:** `POST`  

**Inputs:**
```json
{
  "code": "print('Hello')"
}
```

**Expected Output:**
```
HTTP Status Code: 400 and error message about missing user_id
```

**Actual Output:**
```
HTTP Status Code: 400
JSON: {"message": {"user_id": "User ID is required"}}
```

**Result:** `Success`
