# Team 11 - Software Engineering Project

This repository contains the entire application (backend and frontend) for the Team 11 Software Engineering Project. The backend is built using Flask and integrates with Firebase and Google Cloudâ€™s Gemini API (Generative Language API) to implement all the user stories, while the frontend is built separately using ReactJS and interacts with the backend.

This README provides detailed, step-by-step instructions for setting up and running the full application, as well as configuring Firebase and the Gemini API.

# **Option 2: Manually Set Up Backend and Frontend**

If you prefer, you can manually set up both the backend and frontend by following these steps:
(Make sure the .env file is fully ready as per the instructions before moving forward)

#### **Setting Up and Running the Backend**

1. **Clone or Copy the Project Folder:**
   - Ensure you have the complete project folder.

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
   - Navigate to the backend folder:
     
```bash
cd backend
```
   
   - Create a virtual environment:
     
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```
   
   - Activate the virtual environment:
       
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
